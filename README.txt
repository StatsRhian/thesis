This zip file contains a thesis template designed for STOR-i PhD students. 

The style of the template is based upon the template used by the Maths and Stats department, and therefore should adhere to any university regulations regarding thesis style.

The template is pretty simple to use. There's a master file in the main directory called "Thesis.tex". You'll need to make some simple modifications to this file by adding your name, thesis title and date of thesis submission. Everything else in this file should be fully automated.

In order to create your thesis you'll notice that in the main directory there are folders labelled "Chapter X". In each of these folders there's a ".tex" file which you need to fill with your own work. It's all pretty straightforward, simply type/copy&paste each chapter of your thesis into the corresponding ChapterX.tex file.

Figures should be added to the "figures" folder within each chapter folder.

There's also a References.bib file for all of your references.

Finally, there's a style file "packages_input.tex" which contains all of the packages, macros and any new commands you wish to create. You may find that when you try to compile the thesis you get a warning about missing LaTeX packages. If your thesis does not require the package in question, for example "tks-graph", then simply comment out that package from packages_input.tex or download the necessary packages.

Well that's all folks! By the time you start using this template I hopefully won't be around to help you, but I'm sure that you'll figure it out amongst yourselves.

All the best,

Chris Nemeth
